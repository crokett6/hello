**Practical and streamlined tools to boost your Unity workflow**

Here you'll find a collection of tools I've built to help speed up your development process.  
My goal is to save you time and let you focus on what truly matters: **creating great games**.

## 🎯 Featured Tool

### ✅ [SpriteAtlasAnalyzer](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/327790)  
When working on a project with a large number of sprites, it's essential to pack them into Sprite Atlases to improve rendering performance. However, as your project grows, and especially if you're organizing sprites across multiple atlases, it becomes easy to overlook some sprites or accidentally include the same sprite in more than one atlas.

SpriteAtlasAnalyzer helps you detect and resolve these issues efficiently.<br>
The tool includes two main features:
- Identify sprites that are not packed into any atlas  
- Detect sprites duplicated across multiple atlases
